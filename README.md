# Data Science Projects

This is a repository of data science projects that I have completed over the course of my undergraduate and graduate studies and my 12-week training at Digital Futures Academy.

| Project | Language | Team/Individual | Description |
| --- | :---: | :---: | --- |
| [Amazon Product Q&A Analysis](https://github.com/bnhim01/data_science_projects/tree/main/amazon_product_qa_nlp) | Python | Team | Utilises NLP techniques to analyse products' Q&A comments on Amazon and builds a model to identify useless answers in the Q&A section. |
| [Car Flipping Business](https://github.com/bnhim01/data_science_projects/tree/main/car_flipping_business) | Python | Team | Simulates a car flipping business which purchases used cars and resells them at higher prices. A linear model is built to predict the prices of the used cars, which are then applied with business rules to obtain the profitable purchase prices. |
| [Customer Churn Prediction](https://github.com/bnhim01/data_science_projects/tree/main/customer_churn_prediction) | Python | Team | A classification model is built to predict whether customers would churn from the business. |
