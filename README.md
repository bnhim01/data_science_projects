| [Car Flipping Business](https://github.com/bnhim01/data_science_projects/tree/main/car_flipping_business) | Python | Simulates a car flipping business which purchases used cars and resells them at higher prices. A linear model is built to predict the prices of the used cars, which are then applied with business rules to obtain the profitable purchase prices. |
