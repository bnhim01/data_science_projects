# Credit Card Fraud Detection

In this project, my team and I attempted to detect fraudulent credit card transactions. DBSCAN is utilised to identify outliers, which are treated as potential anomalies for further investigations. A flagging system is also used to detect potential anomalies which are then combined with results from DBSCAN to form the final list of anomalies.

The dataset contains 24,386,900 observations and 14 variables.
