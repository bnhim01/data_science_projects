# Customer Churn Prediction

In this project, I build a classification model to predict customer churn in a telecommunication company. Models attempted include logistic regression, support vector machine, decision trees, and random forest. Oversampling techniques are also explored to mitigate the class imbalance issue in the dataset.

The dataset is stored in the [repository](https://github.com/bnhim01/data_science_projects/blob/main/customer_churn_prediction/customer_churn.xlsx) and can also be found on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/yeanzc/telco-customer-churn-ibm-dataset).
