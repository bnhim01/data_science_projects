# Car Flipping Business

In this project, I simulate a car flipping business which earns profit by purchasing used cars and selling them at higher prices. A linear model is utilised to predict the prices of the cars based on their features such as mileage, BHP, model, etc. A function is then created to apply business rules to obtain purchase prices that will be profitable for the business.

The data is obtained from AutoTrader using a webscrapping function. This project focuses on used BMW cars.
